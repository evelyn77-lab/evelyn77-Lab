## Citations

I used Google to help me complete this assignment. My first search was "All Commands for Mac Terminal and their uses," which gave me a clear understanding of the commands before applying them. After that, I relied on Google to guide me through most of the activities. While I already had an idea of what to do, Google helped me structure my approach. By the time I reached the tenth question, I felt confident and knew exactly what to do.
